        <p>During my time at the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences, I actively participated in the Cleanmobility project. This project involved a dedicated group of students working on the development of smart and eco-friendly vehicles. In my second year, I was deeply involved in the creation of a new generation solar-powered boat. During my final year, I contributed to the development of an innovative wind-resistant car.</p>

        <p>In my fourth year of studies, my initial role did not include participation in the solar boat team. However, due to technical challenges and a lack of expertise within the team, I eventually became part of it. Unfortunately, we faced a major setback when our propulsion system malfunctioned during a crucial test voyage, just before a race. I was called upon to help resolve these pressing issues.</p>

        <p>Thanks to my experience with the boat and the event, I ended up accompanying the team to Monaco. My primary responsibility was troubleshooting technical problems that stumped the team. Regrettably, the problems we thought were resolved persisted. We discovered water infiltration in the stern, which was supposed to be completely waterproof. Despite our efforts to replace all possible seals, the issue persisted. Additionally, motor encoder problems compounded the situation, preventing us from sailing during the initial days. It wasn't until the last day that I proposed a potential solution: a comprehensive inspection revealed that the entire rudder, made of carbon fiber with a 3D-printed core, was the source of the leak. After replacing the rudder, the problem seemed to be resolved.</p>

        <p>The breakthrough in resolving the leak occurred approximately an hour before the start of the final race element. This development raised our hopes of participating in the final race element. Ultimately, we succeeded in making the propulsion system watertight once more. However, due to a lack of both patience and materials, a cable break occurred in the data cable. This led to the failure of the motor encoder, rendering us unable to use the newly developed motor driver. In a last-ditch effort, we installed a replacement motor driver in the final fifteen minutes, but it suffered from various defects due to transportation and insufficient attention.</p>

        <p>In the end, we managed to get the propulsion system working just one minute before the start of the final race element. This allowed us to participate in the race and win two of them. Consequently, we improved our overall standing, moving up from last place to the second-to-last position.</p>

        <p>Despite the numerous challenges and setbacks we faced, we are ultimately very pleased with this outcome.</p>
