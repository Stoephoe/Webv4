        <p>During my fourth year of studies, I had the opportunity to participate in an innovation lab project. In this project, I focused on developing new turbine blades for the upcoming headwind car in the Cleanmobility project. At the project's outset, I conducted research into various existing solutions and methods. It quickly became apparent that there was no suitable software available for designing a turbine specifically for a car. This led me to delve into the theory behind what are known as "dynamic" turbines.</p>

        <p>The theory typically used for designing turbines is called the BEM method, which helps determine the most optimal shape for a turbine blade. However, creating a dynamic turbine required a different theoretical approach. Through a contact at DTU, I received valuable guidance. It became clear that the problem couldn't be solved using existing software; only custom software would enable us to achieve an optimal product. Consequently, I embarked on developing my own software called "StoefoeBlade" to optimize the blade design.</p>
    
        <p>The primary goal was to deliver a product as part of the innovation lab project. However, this proved challenging due to the time required for software development. Ultimately, the project resulted in a design and an initial version of the software. We validated the software's outcomes using Q-blade.</p>
    
        <p>Since we hadn't yet reached a final product, a significant amount of work remained. This workload couldn't be handled solely by the headwind car team. To complete the remaining tasks, I was given the opportunity to use the remaining content for my graduation project.</p>
    
        <p>During the graduation project, my focus shifted to producing the first physical product. I was responsible for designing and fabricating all the necessary components. Given the complexity of the materials and shape involved, it was essential to conduct physical tests on the blade's structural properties rather than relying solely on calculations or simulations. To facilitate this testing, I designed and constructed a test bench capable of loading the blade from two directions and measuring the load. The test results clearly demonstrated that the blade would be robust enough for its intended application.</p>
    
        <p>With the knowledge gained from the testing and prototype phase, I continued to refine the blade design for the final product. An updated version of the software was used, and additional efforts were made to optimize the blade's construction.</p>
    
        <p>In the end, the final product received an impressive score of 9.5, a result that fills me with great pride.</p>
