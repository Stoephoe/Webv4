    <p>During my time at university during my graduation period, I was part of a team known as the "Headwind Team." Together, we spent a year developing a new generation of headwind cars. Our primary playground for testing these cars was the annual Aeolus race in Den Helder, where teams from all over the world come together to compete and determine who has the best headwind car.</p>

    <p>As we prepared for the 2023 race, we worked tirelessly on our latest creation. Due to tight schedules, we only managed to finish building the car for testing just one day before the race. Eager to see how it would perform, we headed to the dike a day early for our first test run.</p>

    <p>This year marked the debut of our new car in the competition. In the previous year's championship in 2022, we had managed to clinch the world championship title with our old car. To pay homage to our trusty veteran, we decided to let the old car participate in the event, albeit with a fresh coat of paint.</p>

    <p>However, the actual race threw us a curveball with very little wind to work with. While the old car once again demonstrated its prowess in these conditions, our new car faced challenges due to the lack of wind for proper testing. Furthermore, the race conditions were quite different from what we had designed the car for.</p>

    <p>In the end, we emerged victorious in the drag race with our new car, securing second place with the old car. The new car also received the prestigious innovation award. Consequently, our new car proudly claimed the third spot, closely followed by our trusty old car in fourth place.</p>

    <p>The ultimate goal of this competition is to achieve the highest possible efficiency, measured by the ratio of average driving speed to average wind speed. In unfavorable conditions, our new car achieved an impressive unofficial score of 73%. Meanwhile, our old car set a new personal record of 52%, surpassing its previous mark of 46%. As a team, we couldn't be happier with these results.</p>
