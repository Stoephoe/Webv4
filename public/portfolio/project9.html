        <p style="color: white">During the development of the solar boat, I had several responsibilities, including the development of hydrofoils (also known as wings). As the process unfolded, it became clear that designing and building the hydrofoils fell slightly beyond our existing expertise. To assist in the hydrofoil development, we collaborated with Qconcepts, a company specialized in developing solutions of this nature. The design of the hydrofoils was entirely entrusted to them, and based on the design parameters, we eventually arrived at a joint design.</p>

        <p style="color: white">The shape of the hydrofoils was determined to eliminate the need for dynamic adjustments; the wing shape itself statically regulates the altitude during operation. Ultimately, in collaboration with Q-concepts, we produced the hydrofoils, after which we handled the finishing touches ourselves. To ensure static adjustment of the wings, an adjustment mechanism was designed on the upper side of the front wings. The wings were made from nearly solid carbon, with the remaining space filled with epoxy foam. The production utilized prepreg carbon sheets due to the multiple layers of carbon involved.</p>
    
        <p style="color: white">To attach the hydrofoils to the boat, reinforced attachment points were created on both sides. Both the hydrofoils and the adjustment mechanisms were secured to these points. For the rear wing, a mounting point was established beneath the tail section. To adjust the angle of attack of the rear wing, interchangeable wedges were used. All integral attachments were designed using Fusion 360.</p>
    
        <p style="color: white">Testing of the hydrofoils took place in the summer of 2021, but little success was achieved. During the summer of 2022, we conducted tests once again, this time with success. It marked the first time that the HvA solar boat was able to operate on hydrofoils.</p>
