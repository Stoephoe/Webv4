        <p>During my university graduation period, I was a part of the Headwind Team. Together, we dedicated a year to constructing a cutting-edge headwind car. Our annual highlight was competing in the Aeolus race in Den Helder, where teams from across the globe vied to determine the finest car.</p>

        <p>Following our victory in the 2022 championship, we set our sights on creating an entirely new vehicle. This new car aimed to reestablish HvA's (Hogeschool van Amsterdam) competitiveness in the championship with a modern touch. It featured a sleek, closed aerodynamic cockpit, significantly enhancing its aerodynamic properties. To shed weight, we opted for a closed canopy with a camera for visibility. The composite cockpit was seamlessly integrated into the subframe, housing the transmission, rear wheels, and mast.</p>
    
        <p>Our old car utilized a cumbersome hand steering system, making it challenging to handle. Thus, we made the switch to foot steering. The old car relied on a bicycle's front fork, necessitating a taller cockpit. To simplify attachment, we developed our steering hub with the steering bearing positioned within the hub.</p>
    
        <p>For optimal performance, we incorporated a pitch mechanism, allowing us to adjust the turbine blades to any desired angle. The old car had a bulky, heavy mechanism, which we completely redesigned for the new car. Furthermore, we replaced as many steel components as possible with lightweight aluminum and composite parts.</p>
    
        <p>The final product served as a robust foundation for future enhancements and innovations. During this project, we took pride in crafting most of the parts ourselves, from the aluminum components to the molds for the diffuser.</p>
