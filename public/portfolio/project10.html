        <p style="color: white">During my second and third years of study, I played an active role in the development of the solar boat project. However, in my fourth year, I took a step back from it. Towards the end of that year, I was asked to assist with addressing an issue related to the boat's rudder.</p>

        <p style="color: white">As we had discovered during the summer of 2022, the rudder couldn't withstand the stresses of operating on hydrofoils. Surprisingly, during a test run in 2023, we found that the rudder also couldn't handle the stresses of regular sailing. To address this problem, we improvised a solution in the final week before a race. We worked on a new rudder design, reinforcing the weaker parts by adding continuous carbon strips at various locations to create stronger connections.</p>
    
        <p style="color: white">The tests confirmed that the new rudder was strong enough. However, a new problem emerged. During the lamination process of the new rudder, a crucial step was overlooked, causing the rudder to be non-waterproof. This led to significant issues during the 2023 championship in Monaco.</p>
