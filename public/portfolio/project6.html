        <p style="color: white">During my high school years, I was a member of ZLV, an association that organized various events such as parties, festivals, and movie nights. Within this association, one of my roles was to handle the audiovisual setup.</p>

        <p style="color: white">When I first joined the association, we encountered several issues during school events. These problems included low attendance and short stays by attendees in the venue. Additionally, all our technical equipment was concentrated in one place, which happened to be on the stage. This setup made it challenging to control the lighting and sound effectively, and we couldn't get a sense of what the audience was experiencing.</p>

        <p style="color: white">To address these challenges, I took on the task of creating a new venue concept. With this new concept in place, people stayed in the venue for longer durations, and we were able to control lighting and sound from within the audience area. We also made significant adjustments to the entire lighting plan to enhance the overall experience. As a result of these improvements and the increase in quality, attendance at our events saw a significant boost. Achieving this new plan involved several brainstorming sessions, and we used Capture to fully develop and implement the venue plan.</p>
