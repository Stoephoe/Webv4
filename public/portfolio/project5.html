        <p style="color: white">During my high school years, I was a member of the Musical Association. During this period, we produced various musicals, including "Grease." I was involved from the beginning in designing and building the set for this production. The show was performed in the Forbo Flooring Hall of the Zaantheater. One of the major challenges of this venue was the limited space. The production required a large number of set pieces and cast members, and dealing with a significant amount of props and people in a small space required careful planning. Additionally, there were constraints on available time, workshop space, and budget.</p>

        <p style="color: white">One of the biggest challenges was changing set pieces during the show. Due to the limited space, we couldn't simply put everything on wheels and roll it on and off the stage. This led to the idea of a turntable. The turntable was placed in the center of the stage and was accompanied by movable walls on both sides. During a scene, the next set could be assembled on the back of the turntable, and then it was just a matter of rotating it 180 degrees. The movable walls allowed us to store set pieces backstage. Additionally, we frequently stacked or tilted set pieces to create more space in the wings.</p>

        <p style="color: white">Because of the tight timeline, we rehearsed in an available gym during the week leading up to the performance. Then, the set had to be moved and assembled within a day for the technical run-through the following day.</p>

        <p style="color: white">By using multifunctional set pieces, we managed to fit a large production into a small space. The end result speaks for itself.</p>
