        <p>During the school year of 2023, I was part of the headwind car team. However, due to organizational problems, issues had arisen with both the H2A and EVA. The H2A is the hydrogen car of the Cleanmobility Project, while the EVA is the autonomous car of the Cleanmobility Project. Due to a shortage of active students, the H2A was in poor condition before the race. I offered to address some of the major problems, such as bleeding the brakes and wheel alignment.</p>

        <p>The issues with the H2A, however, were minor compared to the problems with the EVA, which was missing an entire rear suspension. To ensure that the EVA was ready on time, I, along with a few other students, assisted in preparing the rear suspension and steering system.</p>
    
        <p>Given the significant number of problems that occurred at school, I volunteered to accompany the teams to the competition. Both cars were set to participate in the Shell Eco Marathon in Nogaro. During the race, my role was to troubleshoot potential mechanical issues, as the rest of the EVA team consisted of electrical engineering students. In the end, the EVA secured second place in the autonomous race. In the sustainability portion of the event, the EVA ranked 5th.</p>
