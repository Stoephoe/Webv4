        <p>Throughout my attendance at various Cleanmobility competitions, one challenge has consistently stood outâ€”power supply. The Aeolus race, typically held on a dike or public road, presents a scenario where access to electricity is virtually non-existent. At the Shell Eco Marathon, teams are allocated a limited number of power outlets, and the use of additional power strips is strictly regulated. Even during the solar boat race in Monaco, finding accessible power points can be a rare feat. To complicate matters, when we embark on the boat journey back from Monaco to Amsterdam, our support team operates throughout the day without a reliable power source. Should a situation arise where we require electricity to fix a boat malfunction, our only option is to return to the campsite.</p>

    <p>In response to this recurring issue, we brainstormed a solution in the weeks leading up to our vacation. We were fortunate to have access to an older boat battery boasting a capacity of 2 kWh from the solar boat project. This sparked the idea of constructing a portable power station, primarily utilizing existing components, which we affectionately named "the Braccu." The Braccu is essentially a battery paired with a salvaged 2 kW Mastervolt inverter. We pieced together the initial working version using available spare parts. Subsequently, we incorporated several enhancements, including MPPTs for solar panel charging, a waterproof housing mounted on wheels, and a voltage meter.</p>

    <p>During the Aeolus race, the Braccu emerged as a newfound and invaluable addition to the Cleanmobility toolkit.</p>
