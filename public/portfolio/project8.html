        <p style="color: white">During the development of the solar boat, I had several responsibilities, including the design of the propeller blades. These blades are essential for converting the motor's rotational motion into propulsion. During earlier iterations of the blades, concerns arose about excessive deformation under load. The blades are manufactured using a Markforge fiber 3D printer, and the stiffness of printable materials isn't as high as that of aluminum. This deformation could affect the design's performance and efficiency.</p>
    
        <p style="color: white">To investigate the blade's resistance to shape changes, we set up a testing apparatus. We tested different material compositions, primarily focusing on torsional stiffness, and used these tests to determine the most suitable composition.</p>
    
        <p style="color: white">In the subsequent school year, we continued to refine the propeller blades. Worries about the connection between the blade and the hub led us to create a new design. This new design integrates the hub and the blade, resulting in a sturdier configuration.</p>
    
        <p style="color: white">To create the propeller blade's shape, we employed Openprop, a script executed in Matlab. After inputting the design parameters, the script calculates the most optimal geometry, which is then transformed into a manufacturable product using Fusion 360.</p>
