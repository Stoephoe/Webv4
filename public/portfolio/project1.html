        <p style="color: white">During my second year of study, I was selected for the Cleanmobility project. In this project, students work on smart and clean vehicles. For this project, I worked on building a solar boat, a boat that, as the name suggests, runs on solar energy. During this project, our team had the opportunity to work on the entire development of the boat, from the initial design to the production of the final product.</p>

        <p style="color: white">For this process, we started with a hull design, and a mold was produced from this hull design. The carbon hull was built using the mold. To ensure that the boat would not fail on the open sea, we used a sandwich construction, consisting of a layer of carbon, a layer of foam, and a second layer of carbon. To add additional structural support to the boat, we used frames made of the same material as the hull. Finally, the hull was equipped with a deck, on which the panels were attached.</p>
    
        <p style="color: white">We managed to create a product within a year, after which the boat had its maiden voyage in the inland waters of South France.</p>
