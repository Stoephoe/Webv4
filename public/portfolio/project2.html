        <p style="color: white">For my minor at the RMI, I worked on a final project involving a mini TransAt boat. During this assignment, our group collaborated to construct a miniature sailboat. The Mini TransAt is a race in which model boats must autonomously cross the Atlantic Ocean.</p>

        <p style="color: white">Throughout this project, we followed the entire process from the initial design to the final production. Due to the pandemic, I completed a significant portion of the work from home. During the project, I focused on designing the boat. The hull shape was created using Rhino, and we conducted analyses in Maxsurf to optimize its form. The boat featured twin rudders, a daggerboard, and a canting keel. All components were designed with 3D printing in mind.</p>

        <p style="color: white">Ultimately, we designed everything so that the boat could be fully assembled within 2 days. The boat was equipped with a remote control. In the end, we emerged as winners of the intercollegiate student competition with this boat.</p>
