        <p style="color: white">For her senior project, a friend wanted to produce a play that revolved around the challenging lives of teenagers. When I got involved in the project, the script and cast were already in place, but what was lacking was the facilitation. At the time, I was working as a technician at FluXus, and due to our good relationship, this theater was chosen as the location.</p>

        <p style="color: white">The Fluxus theater presented a lot of challenges. The venue was originally intended for music and dance and had never been used for such a large play before.</p>

        <p style="color: white">For this production, I was partially responsible for designing the set, with the additional challenge of limited physical space on the stage. Furthermore, there was a desire to create wings where there originally were none. Additionally, there was a limited budget for building the set, which led to the use of recycled parts from previous productions. Finally, the set had to be designed to be easily dismantled since the stage was needed for rehearsals by another group between shows.</p>

        <p style="color: white">The lighting design presented a challenge of at least equal magnitude. The venue had various fixtures, but they were not originally meant to illuminate smaller parts of the stage. In addition, the standard lighting package of the venue consisted of only pars, pins, and spots. Moving and LED lights were used from a colleague's available inventory. The lighting plan was pre-designed using Capture, which had previously captured the set design. During the performance, the lights were operated from a Chamsys lighting console. To enable more complex transitions, a show was programmed in advance.</p>

        <p style="color: white">We are very proud of the final result, and the senior project was graded with a 9.</p>
