        <p>During my third year of studies, I had the opportunity to undertake an internship at Forbo Flooring in Assendelft. This company specializes in the production of linoleum flooring and boasts its own engineering department on-site, owing to the unique nature of its product.</p>

        <p>The production process is comprised of multiple steps carried out across various lines within the factory. Among these lines, the oldest one is Line three, which still operates on a batch production basis. In contrast, all other lines have been upgraded to continuous production. Forbo Flooring's future goal is to transform Line three into a continuous production line as well.</p>
    
        <p>My initial task during the internship involved creating a 3D model for a machine known as the "sausage mill." This machine is crucial for the continuous mixing of the product. Despite its long-term use, there was no existing 3D model available. I dedicated the initial weeks to constructing a comprehensive 3D assembly based on the original engineering blueprints.</p>
    
        <p>The latter part of my internship focused on devising concepts for a potential replacement setup. This new setup needed to be implemented in phases to minimize downtime. Additionally, I conducted a thorough assessment of the components that required replacement and devised a plan for the removal of the old components from the premises.</p>
    
        <p>While formulating the new concepts, a novel raw material dosing system was proposed. Since this dosing method had never been utilized before, it necessitated thorough testing. To conduct these tests, a crane was required, but such equipment was available only in limited areas within the factory. Consequently, I designed a specialized test setup for the specific location, enabling the evaluation of the new dosing system. However, despite successfully completing the implementation and production phase, it was discovered that the dosing system was not suitable for the intended purpose.</p>
    
        <p>Ultimately, the experience underscored the immense value of pre-testing the new system, despite the challenges encountered along the way.</p>
