        <p style="color: white">Through the knowledge I gained during my studies, I developed an interest in 3D printing. In my second year of study, I purchased my first 3D printer, a Prusa Mini. However, I was not satisfied with just that. Inspired by the internet, I decided to build my own printer, and at that time, the Voron 2.4 was the most popular DIY printer. I bought all the necessary components and began the construction. While building it, I got inspired by the concept of a toolchanger. Before the Voron could print anything, I started the conversion to a toolchanger. Not many people take on this challenge, so I found myself in unfamiliar territory. Most of the parts for the toolchanger are my own design and were 3D printed on my Prusa.</p>

        <p style="color: white">The toolchanger went through several iterations. Initially, it was a simple addition to the Voron, but it proved not to be strong enough. However, the concept of a lift for print heads persisted. The second iteration showed more promise, but I encountered issues with the cabling of the print heads. After that, I decided to make a permanent extension that didn't require additional moving axes. I also modified the movement of the Z-axis from a moving gantry to a moving bed on ball screws.</p>

        <p style="color: white">After the conversion, very little of the original Voron remains, only the electronics, the print bed, the frame, and the rails are original. The printer is fully operational and can now print with two print heads. It's now just a matter of fine-tuning the systems.</p>
