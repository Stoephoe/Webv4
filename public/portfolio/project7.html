        <p style="color: white">During the last months of my high school years, there was a need for a new lighting plan. The new lighting plan was already 2 years old by then, and we had also learned some things from it. Due to the low ceiling in the hall, the lighting was suspended at the height of the DJ, often causing the light to be blocked by people on the stage. To address this, the concept of the diagonal setup was developed. Additionally, the old setup used a lower beam to add more depth to the lighting, but this beam had to be completely dismantled after use, which was time-consuming. Furthermore, there was a desire to create a more permanent setup that would require less time to set up.</p>

        <p style="color: white">The new plan could only be used briefly due to the outbreak of the pandemic. After the pandemic, the setup was put back into use and was minimally modified due to high satisfaction.</p>
