        <p>For the musical "Zaanlands," I've been part of various productions, and during these productions, I've taken on different roles. We had good connections with various groups in the neighborhood, and one of these groups urgently needed a lighting technician. I was asked to fill this role.</p>

    <p>The group was about to start performing "Sister Act" within three weeks, leaving minimal time for preparation. Coincidentally, a friend of mine was asked to handle the sound for the show.</p>

    <p>Before the show, I created a digital version of the venue in Capture. Using this digital model, I designed a lighting plan for the performance. However, on-site, we realized that the available time was more limited than initially planned, and with some improvisation, the existing lighting was suitable for the show with a few additions from Musical Zaanlands.</p>

    <p>Programming in MagicQ turned out to be quite challenging due to the suboptimal placement of the fixtures. Ultimately, the show relied entirely on cues, requiring only cues to be triggered for each scene, with some manual adjustments. This turned out to be a more significant challenge than anticipated, given the amount of improvisation and inconsistencies between the shows.</p>

    <p>Despite the setbacks, I am satisfied with the outcome.</p>
