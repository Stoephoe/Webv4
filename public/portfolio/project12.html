        <p>During the summer of 2022, I was a part of the HvA solar boat team. Interestingly, during that school year, we decided not to form a team to work on the wind-powered car project. As the name suggests, a wind-powered car is a vehicle that moves forward using energy from headwinds. We wanted to gain experience with the existing car as we had plans to build a new wind-powered car in the school year of 2023. The mentor from the solar boat team was transitioning to the wind-powered car project in 2023 and invited me and another student to participate in the competition, which was held on the dike in Den Helder.</p>

        <p>Despite the car being completely disassembled due to the university's relocation, we decided to participate anyway. The car was reassembled for the first time in a hotel where part of the event was organized.</p>
    
        <p>During the event, we faced minimal wind conditions, which prevented most other teams from driving. What set our car apart was its ability to operate efficiently in extremely low wind conditions.</p>
    
        <p>Additionally, a drag race was organized as part of the event. To compete for victory, we had to participate in this segment. However, our car lacked the systems required to start from a standstill. We found a solution thanks to a loophole in the rules that allowed the use of an accessory in the drag race. We improvised a kind of stand that lifted the rear wheels off the ground, allowing the turbine to start. To drive away, we only needed to release the brake. Thanks to this innovation, we won the drag race.</p>
    
        <p>Based on our car's overall performance during the earlier days of the event, we ultimately claimed the world championship title.</p>
